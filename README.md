# A Numerical Vector Library in C

Inspired by some really good signal processing packages, mainly numpy, I decided to create my own functions for manipulating vectors in C. 
It is part of my own exercise on signal processing, as well an old attempt of creating a simulation environment for solving differential equations in microprocessors.

**Description**

* Usually, in this repo you will find the vectorLib.h and vectorLib.c containing the manipulated code;
* A main.c may change according to the examples I'm making to test the functions I designed;
* The updates to this repo may vary according to the time available in my work schedule.

## Makefile

To run the code, execute the commands on the Makefile. Credits to Nicomedes for their great Makefile creation tool ([link here](https://nicomedes.assistedcoding.eu/#/dashboard))
